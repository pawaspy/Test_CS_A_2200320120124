## Features

1. **Login Page**: A login page where users can enter their credentials. Basic client-side validation checks if the entered credentials match hardcoded values.
2. **Currency Converter Dashboard**: Once logged in, users are redirected to a currency converter dashboard where they can perform currency conversions.
3. **Validation Alerts**: If login fails, an alert message appears to inform the user.

*Note: This project does not include backend functionality; login validation and currency conversion are implemented only on the front end.*
